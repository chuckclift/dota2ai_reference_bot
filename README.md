 This dota bot implementation utilizes the "DOTA 2 AI Framework" mod to control
a bot.  The mod source is hosted on github (https://github.com/lightbringer/dota2ai),
and it includes a reference implementation of a bot.  This is an implementation
that lets you program the bot in python.  To run this one, you just install 
flask (pip install flask), and you run the script.
